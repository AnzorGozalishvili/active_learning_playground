# Pytorch Lightning
Good abstraction level on top of pytorch, but one thing that's missing is the abstraction of data for active learning

# Deep-Active-Learning (https://github.com/ej0cl6/deep-active-learning/tree/7ec066218ab56a30e376df48305775eb8ba83a2c/query_strategies)
Simple Deep Learning abstractions for active learning

# ModAL
Another implementation of active learning on scikit-learn

# BAAL (Bayesian Active Learning)
Good abstraction of data for active learning, ## TODO: complete text here
